## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report suspected vulnerabilities to `security@creditfraud.example` or file a GitHub issue tagged `security` if you cannot send mail. Provide a clear description, proof of concept, and your contact details so we can reach you for follow-up. Expect an acknowledgement within 48 hours and status updates at least every week while we investigate. If the issue is confirmed, we will work with you (and the broader community if needed) to patch the upstream code, publish a CVE when appropriate, and notify downstream users.
